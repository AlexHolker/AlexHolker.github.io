      <h3>Equipment</h3>
      <p>The Houses of Hive City produce prodigious quantities of weapons, ammunition and other equipment, and as their eyes and ears out in the Ash Wastes, their prospectors are well equipped. In addition to the House's usual common equipment, all weapons that are usually treated as common during gang creation remain common equipment for the entire campaign.</p>

      <table class="statstable">

          <th>M</th>

      <h3>Patron House</h3>
      <p>When creating a House Prospector team, choose one of the six main Houses. The patron house determines the team's access to equipment and skills as indicated above.</p>

      <h3>Leadership</h3>
      <p>Members of a House Prospector team will never challenge the Chief Engineer for leadership. If the Chief Engineer dies, her Leader ability is passed to the Engineer with the most Techno skills - or the Engineer with the highest experience if there is a tie.</p>

      <h3>Income</h3>
      <p>A House Prospector team may not work territories, and instead possesses a House Prospector Contract. After every game, roll on the <a href="territories.html#prospector">Prospector Finds</a> table. All income is added directly to their stash.</p>
      <p>A gang that seizes the Prospector team's territory may loot it for 100 credits, and you must pay 50+4D6 credits to replace the stolen gear. If you do not have enough credits in your stash, the excess is written off.</p>

      <h3>Transport</h3>
      <p>A House Prospector team follows the normal rules for vehicle availability. You may not buy beasts unless you have vehicles with sufficient transport capacity to carry them.</p>

      <h3>Hired Guns</h3>
      <p>To ensure their discretion, you must pay double the normal fee for any hired guns you employ.</p>

      <h3>Guild Law</h3>
      <p>As representatives of their House, a Prospector team may not jeopardise their relationship with the Guild by committing illegal acts. If you hire an outlaw hired gun, halve your income from finds after the next battle. If you attack a Guilder, you earn no income from finds after the next 1D3 battles.</p>
