        <p>My first game, Jinx's Rocket Ride, was a side-scrolling dodge-the-obstacles League of Legends fan game created for April Fools' in 2014. It was written from scratch in Java using the Swing libraries for the GUI.</p>
        <p>My second game, Mirkwood, a top-down brawler, was a 2017 group project for university. It was made in the Unity engine with C# for scripting.</p>
